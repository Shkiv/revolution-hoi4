  1914_NAME:0 "The Great War"
  1914_DESC:0 "Contradictions between the great powers: Germany, France, Great Britain, Austria-Hungary, Russia, Turkey, Italy - have been developing and exacerbated for many years. The Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 recorded a new balance of power in Europe, which did not suit everyone. For the years that have passed since that war, there has been a sharp rise in the productive forces throughout the world. Especially in the US and Japan. A new big war is inevitable."
